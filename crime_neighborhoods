I was curious if any of the townships had particularly more of specific types of calls, such as overdosees or violent crimes such as stabbings.
The collowing code is a quick comparison of those features to determine if there is such a township and which they are:
"""

import numpy as np, pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
df = pd.read_csv('911.csv')

#Adding a new column describing the specific reason EMS was called:
df['specific_EMS'] = df[df['reason']=='EMS']['title'].apply(lambda title:title.split(': ')[1])

#Plotting both the top and tail values for these specific calls
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
df[df['reason']=='EMS']['specific_EMS'].value_counts()[:25].plot(kind='bar')

plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
df[df['reason']=='EMS']['specific_EMS'].value_counts()[-25:].plot(kind='bar')

#Checking overdose cases in townships:
df[df['specific_EMS']=='OVERDOSE'].groupby('twp')['title'].count().sort_values(ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
df[df['specific_EMS']=='OVERDOSE'].groupby('twp')['title'].count().sort_values(ascending=False)[:25].plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Overdoses per township')
plt.xlabel=('Township')
plt.ylabel=('Number of Overdoses')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.01, 1),borderaxespad=0)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)

#Now stabbings:
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
df[df['specific_EMS']=='STABBING'].groupby('twp')['title'].count().sort_values(ascending=False).plot(kind='bar')
plt.title('Stabbings per Township')
plt.xlabel=('Township')
plt.ylabel=('Number of Stabbings')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.xticks(rotation=90)

"""
Just from the simple queries above I would personally stay away from two townships which have overwhelmingly more overdoses and stabbings than the other
townships. They are Norristown and Pottstown. More analysis will be added as I continue exploring the dataset on my own!
